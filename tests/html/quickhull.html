        <h1>Quickhull test results</h1>
        <p>
            Quickhull had the best overall results. Even though the worse case
            complexity of quickhull is O(n<sup>2</sup>) it works very fast in
            average case. It is impossible to create such a case which is big
            enough on a computer with enough precision. QuickHull performed
            worse than Graham's Scan in the 2nd testcase only. This was probably
            because of the skewed nature of a parabola which makes the division
            of points not equal on both sides of a line
