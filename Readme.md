# Convex Hull Algorithms

An API which provides implementation of various convex hull algorithms. Made as a part of the computation geometry course at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus

This API provides a Point class with some general functions about it and 3 Convex Hull Algorithms:

-   Graham's Scan (grahamScan.hpp and grahamScan.cpp)
-   Jarvis March (jarvisMarch.hpp and jarvisMarch.cpp)
-   QuickHull (quickHull.hpp and quickHull.cpp)
